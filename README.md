# my-br-lex

Slightly modified version of the [`br-lex` class](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/br-lex) for LaTeX documents. For personal use only, but feel free to download it too. Please refer to [the CTAN website](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/br-lex) for further information on the original document class. I would like to thank Youssef Cherem for sharing his work.
